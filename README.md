# Introduction

Welcome to the help documentation for the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org), a comprehensive and robust data integration for access and visualisation of drug targets associated with diseases. The Platform brings together multiple data types and implements a scoring framework on target-disease associations to assist in the identification and prioritisation of drug targets.
