# Introduction

Welcome to the help documentation for the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org), a comprehensive and robust data integration resource for access and visualisation of drug targets associated with diseases. 

The Platform brings together multiple [data sources](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/data-sources) and implements a scoring framework on target-disease associations to assist in the identification and prioritisation of drug targets.
