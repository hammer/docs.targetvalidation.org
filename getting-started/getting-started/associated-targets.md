# Associated targets

When you search for a disease, you will find all possible targets associated with that disease. You will see these targets in a table format, with cells ordered by the association score. The colour of the cells represents the strength of the association, ranging from white \(no association\) to dark blue \(strong association\). 

You can filter the targets by the data types supporting the association \(e.g. Genetic associations, Somatic mutations\), by pathway types containing the target \(e.g. Signal Transduction, Metabolism\) and by the class of the target associated with the disease \(e.g. Surface antigen, Secreted protein\). You can also restrict the targets displayed in the table by filtering the table with your target list.
