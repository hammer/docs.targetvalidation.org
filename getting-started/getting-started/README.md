# Getting started

The Open Targets Platform supports workflows starting from a target or disease to assist drug discovery scientists in the identification and prioritisation of drug targets. The Platform provides:

* Target–disease associations and underlying evidence
* Target annotations \(e.g. RNA and protein baseline expression\)
* Disease annotations \(e.g. Disease Classification\)

A drug target can be a protein, protein complex or RNA molecule. It is displayed by its official gene name from the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee, [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org/). We integrate all evidence available for a target using [Ensembl stable IDs](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/index.html), and describe relationships between diseases by mapping them to [Experimental Factor Ontology](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/) \(EFO\) terms.

The [Open Targets Platform](http://www.targetvalidation.org/) is a comprehensive and robust data integration for access and visualisation of  drug targets associated with diseases.
