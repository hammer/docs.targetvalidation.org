# What is target tractability?

Tractability of a target is the confidence that we can identify a modulator that interacts with the target to elicit a desired biological effect. 

Our definition is derived from “[Ligandability of Drug Targets: Assessment of Chemical Tractability via Experimental and In Silico Approaches](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527677047.ch03)" by Udo Bauer and Alexander L. Breeze.

Head to our [target tractability](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/getting-started/target-tractability) page to learn how to explore this data in the profile page of a target, such as [APP](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000142192?view=sec:tractability), or in the associations page of a disease, such as [Alzheimer's](https://www.targetvalidation.org/disease/EFO_0000249/associations?view=t:priority&fcts=datatype:genetic_association;somatic_mutation;known_drug;affected_pathway), under the Prioritisation view.
